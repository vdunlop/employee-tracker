## Installation-Execution

Open a command terminal, go to the note-taker folder and execute server.js using the command "node server.js". This will start your server.

Open a browser and type localhost:3001.

The browser will open the main screen for Note Taker. Click on <Get Started>.

Once you are in the notes list screen, you can do the following:

1. Type in a Note Title and Note Text and click <Save Note> to create a note.

2. Type in a Note Title and Note Text and click on <Clear> to clear out what you've typed.

3. Click on an existing note to have it show on the right side screen with details. You will also see the <New Note> button appear.

4. Click on the "delete" symbol next to any note and it will be deleted and the left side list will be updated.

## Usage

The Note Taker app can be used to keep track of your to do list. You can add your to-do item (like washing the car) along with a title. You can also delete items off of your list as you complete them. Your items with their titles will be saved in a local file on your computer, so that if you exit out of the app and then go back in, your list will still be accurate.
